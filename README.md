# 🚀 QtPlot — Next-Gen Scientific Plotting & Data Analysis Platform

> A modern, AI-powered, collaborative alternative to QtiPlot built using **PyQt/PySide**.

QtPlot AI is a desktop scientific data analysis and visualization software inspired by **QtiPlot / Origin / MATLAB Plot Tools**, extended with:

- 🤖 **AI Chatbot Companion for Data Insights**
- 👥 **Real-time Collaboration**
- 📊 **Multi-table, Multi-plot Interactive Analysis**
- ⚡  **Fast, Lightweight, Native Desktop UI**

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Core Plotting & Data Analysis

- Multi-table workspace (MDI interface)
- Import CSV files into multiple tables
- Create and manage multiple plots
- Plot rows / columns from any table
- Table editing, renaming, closing, reopening
- Interactive charts & visualizations
- QtiPlot-like workflow

---

### 🤖 AI Chatbot Companion (Your Data Assistant)

> “A companion will always be available 24×7 by your side.”

- Ask questions about your dataset in natural language:
  - "Which column has the highest variance?"
  - "Plot sales vs time and explain the trend"
  - "Is there any correlation in this data?"
- Ask the bot to:
  - Generate plots
  - Explain trends
  - Detect anomalies
  - Summarize datasets
- Chat is **context-aware** of currently opened tables & plots

---

### 👥 Real-Time Collaboration (Like Google Docs for Data)

- Multiple users can:
  - Open same project
  - Edit tables together
  - Create plots collaboratively
  - See changes live
- Live sync of:
  - Tables
  - Plots
  - Annotations
- Shared AI assistant for the team
